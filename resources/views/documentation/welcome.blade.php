            This is TallStackUi, a library of ready-to-use components for TALL Stack applications, based on Livewire V3.
            TallStackUi is unlike anything you've ever seen, from its conception to construction and general
            availability. It's a pleasure to have you on our team. Beforehand we want to tell you a little about the
            history of TasteUi.

            Hey! I'm <a href="https://github.com/devajmeireles" class="underline underline-offset-4" target="_blank">AJ</a>,
            creator of TallStackUi. I'm a FullStack developer passionate about TALL Stack and addicted to the Laravel ecosystem.
            I also cooperate with the PestPHP community and other open-source projects.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            For a long time, I have used a variety of component libraries to create TALL Stack applications. As time
            went by I started to notice that component libraries started to be abandoned: without new features,
            improvements, or updates. There was no shortage of ideas or bugs to be solved. Meanwhile, I was here working
            8 hours a day and having to create components manually just to avoid depending on libraries that I knew
            could stop being supported at any time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            That's how I came up with the idea of creating TallStackUi: a library of TALL Stack components to serve me
            and anyone who wants to believe in the project. <b class="underline underline-offset-4">I believe that the
                main difference you will find with TallStackUi will be my dedication.</b> This way, you have the
            guarantee that the project will be maintained by me as the main developer, after all, I created it mainly to
            use TasteUi in my personal projects.
